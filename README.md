# hiroshima

Here's a project to learn some jquery as well as grow support for disarmement.

Features I'd like to add as I have time:

Use ajax to put data in spreadsheat and update that as arsenals increase and decrease.
Make years since hiroshima go up every year (should be easy!).
Make the code a bit more elegant/efficient by making objects for each country whose variables are plugged into one function by each button.
